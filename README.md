# RedTeams-Notes
this repository contains selected notes from my personal knowledge based on cyber security and systems

I use Obsidian daily to document what I learn while exploring offensive security operating systems and hands-on labs like OverTheWire bandit

# topics 
Linux command line practices
low level OS concepts
key cyber security concepts

these notes are personal but shared for visibility and learning exchange

> **Note**: Most of the current notes are written in French, as they were part of my initial learning process.  
> Moving forward, I plan to write new notes in English to make the content more accessible to a wider audience.
